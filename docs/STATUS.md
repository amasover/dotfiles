# Status — session entry point

Read this first: it's the cheap way to orient without re-reading the PRD and every epic.

**Format contract — keep this file cheap.** This is a disposable handoff note between
agent-assisted sessions, not an archive:

- **In flight** holds one entry per story actually moving: status, where the detail
  lives (issue / PR / epic spec / notes doc / runbook), and what's next or blocking.
  1–3 lines each.
- Nothing may live *only* here. If a detail has no other home, move it to the story's
  issue, an epic spec, or a notes doc — or open an issue — and keep at most a pointer.
- Merged/closed work leaves this file at the next update; the epic ✅ and git history
  are the record. Keep a single **Last session** digest and delete older ones.
- If this file outgrows roughly one screen, it's wrong: trim it, don't append.

Facts:

- **Trunk branch:** `main` (`master` is retired and deleted; never diff/PR against it).
- **Tracking source of truth:** [GitHub Projects board](https://github.com/users/amasover/projects/1/views/1)
  (status) + issues (discussion). Epic `.md` files hold specs only; ✅ on a story heading = issue closed.
- **Secret scanning:** `betterleaks` (gitleaks fallback on the Linux machine) before every
  commit/PR ([recipe](../knowledge/recipes/secret-scan.md)), always paired with a manual
  privacy pass by eye — the scanner misses employer/personal/host details.

## How to start a session

1. Read this file, then the relevant epic's **Stories** section (not the whole epic).
2. Pick up work via its GitHub issue; check `knowledge/` for related recipes.
3. Branch `story/<n>-<slug>` off `main`; one story per branch and PR; PRs against `main` only (never stacked).
4. When a chunk lands, update this file *per the format contract above*.

## In flight

- **The 2026-07-19 23:07 run went fully green** (`bootstrap rc=0` + `check rc=0`, unmanaged empty,
  drift clean) — first ever. It was a *resumed* run; one fresh `destroy` → `up` still supplies the
  fresh-run evidence for **2.19** ([#70](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/70), full log set),
  **2.26** ([#83](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/83), prompt-free from scratch),
  **2.27** ([#87](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/87), `df /` ≈ disk size), and formal
  2.34 DB-age evidence. Aaron plans it soon. The green-run logs (22:19 + 23:07) already carry the
  evidence for **2.32/2.33/2.22** ([#100](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/100)/[#103](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/103)/[#75](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/75)),
  **2.34** ([#107](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/107), zero retrieval failures), and
  2.31's resume — closable at Aaron's call.
- **2.31 resumable `up`** ([#98](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/98)): open for the
  interrupt+resume evidence + the resume gap (a resumed `up` never updates the guest's yadm
  checkout — `yadm clone || true` no-ops; candidate 2-line fix on the issue). The old
  evdi/displaylink hold resolved itself: chaotic ships 6.3-2.1 against evdi 1.15.0, installed clean 07-19.
- **2.21 progress mode** ([#73](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/73)): #102 + #111
  (SIGWINCH resize fix, pty regression test) merged; open for attended transcripts from a green run.
- **2.26 provider pins** ([#83](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/83)): #86/#99/#110 merged
  (PROVIDER_PINS step 3d). Host jack2→pipewire-jack swap stays a live step.
- **2.23 redis→valkey** ([#76](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/76)): [PR #115](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/pull/115)
  **merged** — valkey declared (Aaron's call). Open until the host live swap + clean drift report.
  The *parked* guest has AUR redis installed and would conflict on its next sync — moot if destroyed.
- **2.25 dotnet repo stack** ([#82](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/82)): open for the
  gated host live swap + the `dotnet-runtime-2.1`/`2.2` relic decision; four repo names drift
  declared-but-missing until then.
- **Aaron's pending live steps** (one attended sitting): yadm pull → `yadm gitconfig core.hooksPath
  .githooks` (4.4) → `yadm encrypt` (2.10 baseline files) → chaotic adoption + jack2/redis swaps via
  attended bootstrap/sync (2.28/2.26/2.23).
- **Direction (2026-07-10 grill)**: cleanup era ends at the daily-driver rebuild (a VMware VM
  on the Windows machine, not metal first) + the 1.8 work-machine steps. Record:
  [decision-daily-driver-vm.md](./decision-daily-driver-vm.md), PRD §4 eras, runbook checklist.
  Sequence: fresh evidence run → live steps above → **2.30** ([#96](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/96))
  class+hardware split (now incl. the guest NetworkManager decision) → **2.29** ([#95](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/95),
  amended: daily-VM first) → milestone run; **4.7** ([#94](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/94)) CI parallel; epic 3 after.
- **metapac reinstall churn** (from the 07-19 log review): `yay --sync --asexplicit` without
  `--needed` reinstalls every installed declared package each sync (37–50 per run) — investigation
  in progress, story TBD.
- **2.36 Windows vm-harness** ([#119](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/issues/119)): slice 1
  merged (PR #120); slice 2 open ([PR #121](https://github.com/amasover/dotfiles/pull/121) —
  create/install/boot/ip, validated live) with adversarial-review fixes committed on the branch,
  **push pending Aaron's go**. Slice 3 next: bootstrap/check via shared guest bash, resumable
  `up`, `exec`. 2.37 (daily target) still waits on 2.29/2.30.

## Standing warnings

- **Chat transcripts are sensitive.** Org package names and the work email have each leaked into a
  session transcript (the repo stayed clean). Filter package listings before echoing them, and never
  inline `~/.local/share/metapac/machine-local.toml` contents into tracked files or issues.

## Last session (2026-08-10, Windows machine)

- Adversarial two-axis review of **PR #121** (2.36 slice 2), fixes committed on the branch
  (unpushed). Real bug: serial/`Say` output never reached the phase logs — `Write-Host` is
  information-stream, invisible to `Invoke-Phase`'s `2>&1` Tee — so `tail install` was
  near-empty and `destroy` deleted the only serial copy. Also: vmx parsing centralized
  behind a tested `vm-harness-vmx media` query, install stale-serial + running-VM guards,
  boot now waits for sshd (the same-MAC lease predates the boot, so the IP wait was a
  no-op). pytest 43/43, hook clitest 19/19, driver smoke against the live VM green.
- Environment note: `tests/{quarantine,vm-harness}.clitest.txt` fail on this Windows host
  (`lua5.1`/`setsid`/`script(1)` missing) — pre-existing platform gap, 4.7's CI concern,
  untouched by the PR.
